## Do I have to agree to these terms of use? 
If you want to use the Carbon Intensity API, then yes. National Grid are offering use of the Carbon Intensity API only on the terms posted here. By using the Carbon Intensity API, you are agreeing to follow the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, National Grid does not grant you a license to use the Carbon Intensity API.

## How long can I use the API for? 
Your license to the Carbon Intensity API continues until it is ended by you or National Grid.
How would the license end? Either party can end the license any time for any or no reason. If you want to end the license, just stop using the Carbon Intensity API. That will end the license. If you violate any of the terms below, your license to use the Carbon Intensity API terminates automatically and right away. If National Grid sends you a written notice terminating your license, that also terminates your license right away.

## How can I stay up to date on the terms? 
We might update these terms from time to time without notice or reason.
